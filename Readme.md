# 🌐 Personal Web Challenge - Stroke Mods

Hello everyone!!

This is my **second project** — or I should say a **challenge question** given to me by ChatGPT, which I successfully completed in a beginner-friendly way.  

I’ve added:
- A video background  
- A styled header  
- A navigation bar  
- A table for hobbies  
- An article section with my profile image
